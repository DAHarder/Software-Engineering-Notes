Database Normalization is a technique of organizing the data in the database. Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy(repetition) and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form, removing duplicated data from the relation tables.

Normalization is used for mainly two purposes:
-   Eliminating redundant(useless) data.
-   Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e data is logically stored.

## Normalization Forms:
1. First Normal Form
2.  Second Normal Form
3.  Third Normal Form
4.  BCNF
5.  Fourth Normal Form
