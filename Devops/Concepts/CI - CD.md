# Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery / Deployment

**Continuous integration** refers to the build and unit testing stages of the software release process. Every revision that is committed triggers an automated build and test.

With **continuous delivery**, code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. Continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage.

-   Continuous delivery automates the entire software release process. Every revision that is committed triggers an automated flow that builds, tests, and then stages the update. The final decision to deploy to a live production environment is triggered by the developer. With **continuous deployment**, production happens automatically without explicit approval.
