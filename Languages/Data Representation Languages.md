# YAML
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-friendly data serialization format that is easy to read, write, and understand. YAML uses **indentation** and **simple punctuation marks** to represent the data structure, such as lists and key-value pairs. It is commonly used for configuration files, data exchange between languages with different data structures, and as a more human-readable alternative to XML and JSON.
```yaml
- name: Apple
  color: Red
- name: Banana
  color: Yellow
```

## Syntax
"-" : Item in a List
Key Value pair : Dictionary
Everything in the same line is the same list or dictionary
# JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines. JSON uses key-value pairs and is derived from JavaScript. It is often used for data exchange between a client and a server, as well as for configuration files.
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Apple",
    "color": "Red"
  },
  {
    "name": "Banana",
    "color": "Yellow"
  }
]
```

## Syntax
"\[" : List
"\{" : Dictionary

# XML
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It uses a hierarchical structure with custom tags and attributes to store and describe data. XML is widely used for data interchange, configuration files, and web services.
```xml
<fruits>
  <fruit>
    <name>Apple</name>
    <color>Red</color>
  </fruit>
  <fruit>
    <name>Banana</name>
    <color>Yellow</color>
  </fruit>
</fruits>
```
